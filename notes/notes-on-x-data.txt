# ============================================
# Explanation of the three input channels in dataX (shape: Ns, 3, Nx, Ny)
# ============================================

# Channel 0: SDF from obstacle surface
# -------------------------------------
# This channel encodes the Signed Distance Function (SDF) from the shape of the obstacle inside the flow domain.
# - Negative values: inside the obstacle.
# - Zero: on the surface.
# - Positive values: outside the obstacle (in fluid region).
# Why it's useful:
# => It provides precise geometric information about the obstacle's shape and distance from each point in the domain.
# => Helps the model learn how flow behavior (velocity, pressure) changes relative to proximity to the object.
# => Unlike a binary mask (0 or 1), SDF provides continuous values that enhance learning.

# Channel 1: Flow region classification (multi-label)
# ----------------------------------------------------
# This is a categorical mask where each pixel represents a region type:
# - E.g., inlet, outlet, obstacle, or fluid.
# Why it's useful:
# => Helps the model distinguish between functional areas in the domain (e.g., where fluid enters, exits, or is blocked).
# => Allows the model to understand boundary conditions.
# => Crucial for defining zones of influence and for distinguishing between different flow behaviors.

# Channel 2: SDF from top/bottom boundaries
# ------------------------------------------
# This channel encodes the vertical distance from each point to the nearest horizontal wall (top or bottom).
# Why it's useful:
# => Top/bottom walls often apply no-slip conditions in CFD — fluid sticks to the wall.
# => Flow speed and pressure are heavily influenced by wall proximity due to viscous boundary layers.
# => This channel gives the model a sense of how close a point is to these fixed, global boundaries — even though they don’t change across samples.

# Summary:
# Each channel adds a different type of spatial or semantic information:
# - Channel 0: object geometry (local, changing per sample).
# - Channel 1: region type (semantic labels).
# - Channel 2: proximity to domain borders (global, fixed).
